# SimpleCrafter Environment

A 2D gridworld environment.
The environment consists of a range of resources that the agent needs to collect and use
to make tools that allow them to collect more resources.
The goal of the agent is to collect a diamond in as few timesteps as possible.

A more simple and refined version of the [Crafter environment](https://danijar.com/project/crafter/) (Hafner 2021).

## Transition Dynamics
The agent starts in random empty grid square in the map.
Each timestep the agent moves, collects resources, or crafts equipment.
The environment terminates when the agent collects a diamond. The environment also terminates
when the total wood gathered and in the map is less than $4$, in this case the agent does not
have enough resources to collect a diamond.

## Reward
Each timestep the agent receives the reward of $-0.01$.

When the agent takes an action with no effect (such as collecting when no resources are available to)
they receive a reward of $-0.5$.

Collecting a diamond gives a reward of $2.0$.

Transitioning to a terminal state where there is $4$ or less total wood in the domain
gives a reward of $-3.0$.
